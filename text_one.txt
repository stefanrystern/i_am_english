Once in a while, Microsoft decides to release the "Work and Play Bundle", a collection of one-year subscriptions to its best services at a steep discount.

As of today, and for a limited time, the Work and Play Bundle is back.

And for $149, you get a lot of good stuff, including subscriptions to Xbox Live and Office 365. Think of it as your gateway drug to the new Microsoft.
